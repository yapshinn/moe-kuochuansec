**<u>Subject-Based Banding (SBB)</u>**

  
Our school offers Subject-Based Banding (SBB). With SBB, N(A) students are given the opportunities to offer subjects at a higher-level from the start of Secondary One. This allows students to build a stronger foundation in subjects that they are good at, nurture their strengths and give them more opportunities throughout their educational journey, so that they are more engaged in learning.

**Eligibility Criteria for SBB**

Secondary One N(A) students who meet the following criteria based on their PSLE results are eligible for SBB:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Course</th>
    <th>PSLE Standard Grade</th>
    <th>Option to offer subject at</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>N(A)</td>
    <td>AL5</td>
    <td>Express</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Each student should take no more than 3 higher-level subjects so as to ensure that he/she can cope with the overall academic demands.

**Other Opportunities to Participate in SBB**

For students who did not meet the eligibility criteria for SBB at the start of Secondary One, they can still be considered for SBB if they do well in their learning in Secondary One. These students will join SBB at the end of Secondary One Term 2 or Secondary One Term 4 as the mid-year or end-year SBB inserts.

Our school will provide support through bridging programmes for these new SBB students.
