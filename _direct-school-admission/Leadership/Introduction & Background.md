## Introduction & Background

The KCPian servant leader is a unique individual. On top of being a leader equipped with leadership skill sets to implement ideas and organise teams, the KCPian servant leader is one who is able to **empathise** with the needs of the community, effecting positive change through service.

The servant leader has a heart for the people around them and the concerns that they face; possessing the moral courage to translate these concerns into impactful actions for the improvement of the community.

At KCPSS, we look to develop every KCPian into resilient and responsible servant leaders to be change makers. We do so by putting in place an intentional and structured **equipping** process to provide opportunities for every KCPian to be developed with leadership skills and competencies to effectively lead themselves and others. These include structured leadership workshops and opportunities to lead in different platforms like in our Student Leadership Board and CCA among others. These experiences will in turn allow them to apply what they have learnt in authentic leadership settings.

The school believes in the co-creation of a culture of care, collaboration and excellence through efforts from both students and school – thus students are **empowered** to actively contribute to the community through the ownership of projects and school improvement

Here, we are always on the lookout for passionate, talented and committed individuals who exhibit leadership potential on top of good and consistent character. If you fit the bill, come join us through the Direct Schools Admission (DSA) exercise to allow us to know you better!
